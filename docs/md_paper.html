<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>Turbulence is a complex phenomenon in fluid dynamics involving nonlinear interactions between multiple scales. Structure function is a popular diagnostics tool to study the statistical properites of turbulent flows [:Dissipation; :Structure; :book]. Some of the earlier works comprising of such analysis are those of :PF2002, :PF2003, and :ARFM2009 for three-dimensional homogeneous isotropic turbulence; :PF2005 and :NJP2008 for passive scalar turbulence; :NJP2004 for two-dimensional turbulence; and :PRE2008 and :JFM2013 for turbulent thermal convection. Structure functions are two-point statistical quantities; thus, an accurate computation of these quantities requires averaging over many points. However, incorporation of a large number of points makes the computations very expensive and challenging. Therefore, we require an efficient parallel code for accurate computation of structure functions. In this paper, we describe the design and validation of the results of <code>Kolmogorov41</code>, a hybrid parallel code to compute velocity and scalar structure functions.</p>
<p><code>Kolmogorov41</code>, written in C++, employs a combination of distributed (MPI) and shared (OpenMP) memory parallelization [:book:PP] to compute the structure functions for a given velocity or scalar field. In this code, the entire data is shared in all the MPI processes, thus eliminating the need of communication between the processors. Thus, we save considerable time that would otherwise be spent on communication. The user has a choice on the type (scalar or vector) and the dimensions of the fields to be read by the code, and the range of the orders of the structure functions to be computed. The code writes the computed structure functions to hdf5 files that can be further processed by the user. We remark that our code has been used by :PF2019 for analysing the longitudinal velocity structure functions of turbulent thermal convection.</p>
<p>In the next section, we will briefly define the velocity and the scalar structure functions in turbulence.</p>
<h1>Velocity and scalar structure functions</h1>
<p>Let ${u}$ and $$ be velocity and scalar fields respectively. For any two points ${r}$ and ${r+l}$, we define the velocity differential to be $ {u} = {u(r+l)}-{u(r)}$. Further, we denote $ u_= {u} {{l}}$ as the component of the velocity differential along the vector ${l}$, and $ u_= | {u} -  u_ {{l}}|$ as the component of the velocity differential perpendicular to ${l}$. Assuming statistical homogeneity, we define the longitudinal velocity structure functions of order $q$ as $$ S_q^{u_}({l}) =   u_^q ,$$ and the transverse velocity structure functions of order $q$ as $$ S_q^{u_}({l}) =   u_^q . $$</p>
<p>Here, $  $ denotes ensemble averaging. We can also define the scalar differential to be $  =  ({r+l}) - ({r})$, and the scalar structure functions (assuming statistical homogeneity) as $$ S_q^({l}) =   ^q. $$ If the turbulence is isotropic in addition to being homogeneous, the structure functions become functions of $l$, where $l=|{l}|$. The second-order velocity structure function provides an estimate of energy in the eddies of size $l$ or less [:book:Turbulence].</p>
<p>In the next section, we provide a brief description of the code.</p>
<h1>Design of the Code</h1>
<p><code>Kolmogorov41</code> is written in C++. The code uses the Blitz++ library for vectorized array operations. The velocity structure functions ($S_q^{u_}(l)$ and $S_q^{u_}(l)$) and the scalar structure functions ($S_q^{}(l)$) are computed and stored in a Blitz array. <code>Kolmogorov41</code> contains separate functions for computing the scalar and the velocity structure functions. Also, separate functions are called for two-dimensional or three-dimensional input fields. However, the basic design of all the functions is the same, as described below.</p>
<p>For three-dimensional fields, <code>Kolmogorov41</code> employs six nested "for" loops for computation of structure functions using three-dimensional fields. The outer three loops describe the position vector ${r}=(x_1,y_1,z_1)$, and the inner three describe the position vector ${r+l}=(x_2,y_2,z_2)$. For two-dimensional fields, the code employs four nested "for" loops, with the outer two describing ${r}=(x_1,z_1)$ and the inner two describing ${r+l}=(x_2,z_2)$. Inside the last loop, the code computes $ u_^q(l)$ and $ u_^q(l)$ for the velocity structure functions, or $ ^q(l)$ for the scalar structure functions, and increments these quantities to the corresponding element of the structure function array. For averaging, the code divides the structure functions array by another array that stores the number of times the innermost loop corresponds to a particular value of $l$.</p>
<p>Additionally, as per the choice of the user, <code>Kolmogorov41</code> can also compute and store the structure functions as functions of the displacement vector ${l}$. This form is useful for anisotropic homogeneous turbulence such as rotating or stably-stratified flows.</p>
<p>Using the definition of the longitudinal structure functions, it can be shown that $S_q^{u_}({l})= S_q^{u_}({-l})$. If the user decides to compute only the longitudinal velocity structure functions, <code>Kolmogorov41</code> exploits the aforementioned property by not separately evaluating $S_q^{u_}({-l})$. This saves significant computational costs.</p>
<p>We use a combination of MPI and OpenMP to parallelize our code. The interval of the outermost "for" loop described earlier in this section is divided among MPI processors. Using OpenMP threads, we parallelize the second "for" loop. Note that the entire data is accessible to all the MPI processors, thereby eliminating the need of communication between the processsors. This hybrid parallelization allows us to use a maximum of $N_x  p$ processors, where $N_x$ is the number of grid points along $x$ direction and $p$ is either the number of processors per computation node or the number of grid points along $y$ direction (or $z$ direction for 2D fields), whichever is less.</p>
<p>In the next section, we discuss the validation of our code.</p>
<h1>Results</h1>
<p>We validate <code>Kolmogorov41</code> by using it to compute the structure functions for specific cases, and then comparing our results with those obtained analytically. We validate <code>Kolmogorov41</code> by comparing the numerical results with analytical results for idealized ${u}$ and $$ fields as well as with the predictions of K41 [:Dissipation; :Structure].</p>
<h3>Problem 1</h3>
<p>We consider the following two-dimensional velocity and scalar fields: $${u} = {bmatrix} x \ z {bmatrix},   = x+z. $$ For the above fields, it can be analytically shown that the longitudinal and the transverse velocity structure functions and the scalar structure functions are $$S_q^{u_} = (l_x^2 + l_z^2)^{q/2} = l^q,$$ $$S_q^{u_} = 0,$$ $$S_q^ = (l_x+l_z)^q.$$ We run <code>Kolmogorov41</code> to compute the velocity and scalar structure functions for the above fields. The resolution of the fields and the domain size are $32^2$ and $1  1$ respectively. We plot the second and the third-order longitudinal velocity structure functions versus $l$ in Fig. SFTest}. Clearly, $S_2^{u_}(l)$ and $S_3^{u_}(l)$ equal $l^2$ and $l^3$ respectively, consistent with the analytical results. Figure SFScalar} exhibits the density plots of the computed second-order scalar structure function $S_2^{}({l})$ along with $(l_x + l_z)^2$. The two plots are very similar, thus showing the <code>Kolmogorov41</code> computes the scalar structure function correctly.</p>

</div>
<p>The above problem is used as a test case for the the code. The user is required to execute the shell script <code>Kolmogorov41-master/runTest.sh</code> to run the test case. On doing so, the code generates the velocity and the scalar fields as per the above relation. After computing the structure functions, the code computes the percentage difference between the theoretical and the computed values of the structure functions. If the error does not exceed $1 10^{-10}$, the code is deemed to have passed.</p>

(b) Density plot of $(l_x+l_z)^2$, which is the analytical value of the second-order scalar structure function. The two density plots match identically.\label{SFScalar}"/>
</div>
<h3>Problem 2</h3>
<p>Here, we consider the classical results of Kolmogorov [:Dissipation; :Structure] for three-dimensional incompressible homogeneous isotropic turbulence. In such flows, for the inertial range, which comprises of scales lying between the large-scale forcing regime and the small-scale dissipation regime, the third-order longitudinal velocity structure function is given by $$S_3^{u_}(l) = -{4}{5}  l,$$ where $$ is the viscous dissipation rate [:Dissipation; :Structure; Frisch:book; Verma:book:ET]. For an arbitrary order $q$, :PRL1994 proposed that the longitudinal structure functions scale as $S_3^{u_}(l)  l^{}$, where the exponent $$ is given by $$  = {q}{9} + 2  ( 1 -  ( {2}{3}  )^{q/3}  ).$$</p>
<p>We compute the longitudinal velocity structure functions of $q=3,5,7$ using the simulation data of three-dimensional homogeneous isotropic turbulence with Reynolds number (Re) of 5700. The simulation was performed using TARANG [:Pramana2013tarang; :JPDC2018] on a $512^3$ grid with the domain size of ($2  2  2$). For more details on the simulation, refer to :PRF2019. We run <code>Kolmogorov41</code> on a Cray XC40 system (Shaheen II of KAUST) to compute the structure functions, employing 512 MPI and 32 OpenMP processes. The code took $5  10^4$ seconds to complete the computations under the aforementioned parallelization configuration.</p>

The negative of the normalized third-order structure function is close to $4/5$ (dashed line) in the inertial range. \label{Hydro}"/>
</div>
<p>We normalize the third, fifth, and seventh-order longitudinal velocity structure functions with $( l)^{}$, where $$ is given by She-Leveque's relation. We plot the negative of these quantities versus $l$ in Fig. Hydro}. The figure clearly shows that in the inertial range ($0.2&lt;l&lt;0.8$), the normalized third-order longitudinal velocity structure function is fairly close to $4/5$ (represented by dashed line), consistent with Kolmogorov's theory. Moreover, the normalized fifth and seventh-order structure functions show a plateau for the same range of $l$, thus exhibiting consistency with She-Leveque's model. Note that we expect more accurate results for higher resolution simulations [:Pramana2013tarang].</p>
<p>The results obtained from Problems 1 and 2 thus validate <code>Kolmogorov41</code>.</p>
<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>This paper describes the design and the validations of <code>Kolmogorov41</code>, a hybrid parallel C++ code that computes structure functions for given velocity and scalar fields. We validate <code>Kolmogorov41</code> using two test cases. In the first case, we compute the structure functions using hypothetical velocity and scalar fields, and find them to be consistent with analytical results. In the second case, we compute the velocity structure functions using the fields obtained from the simulations of three-dimensional homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, and show consistency with Kolmogorov's K41 result. We believe that <code>Kolmogorov41</code> will be useful to turbulence community.</p>
